# Troubleshooting

DevRev SDK for Android

# Troubleshooting

* **Issue**: Can't import the SDK into my app.
  **Solution**: Double-check the setup process and ensure that `mavenCentral()` is present in the project level repositories block.
* **Issue**: How does the DevRev SDK handle errors?
  **Solution**: The DevRev SDK reports all errors using Android's logging utility. Look for error messages in Android Studio's Logcat after applying `DEVREV SDK` filter.
* **Issue**: Support chat doesn't show.
  **Solution**: Call one of the identification methods: `DevRev.identifyUnverifiedUser(...)` or `DevRev.identifyVerifiedUser(...)`.
* **Issue**: Not receiving push notifications.
  **Solution**: Configure your app to receive push notifications and register your device with the DevRev SDK.
* **Issue**: Encountering lags across the app.
  **Solution**: In the DevRev org, go to **Settings** > **Session Replays** > **Android Tab** > **General Settings Tab**. Change the **Video Quality** to Low and the **Screenshot Time Interval** to >=800. If these settings are not available, raise a ticket with DevRev support.
* **Issue**: Some of the sessions are missing from the portal.
  **Solution**: Sessions might not be ingested due to multiple reasons. Check the following:

  + Session length is less than the `Exclude sessions less than` time configured in the org settings.
  + The network bandwidth is insufficient for the files to be uploaded to the portal.
  + The app was killed but never launched again in the next 48 hours.
  + Session recordings were disabled for the app.
  + Incorrect app id was provided in the `DevRev.configure(...)` method.
  + Special characters in the session properties/events might lead to file corruption and eventually missed recording.
* **Issue**: App launch time has increased on slow networks.
  **Solution**: Call the `DevRev.setAsyncConfigFetchEnabled(context, true)` method right after calling the `DevRev.configure(...)` method.

## [Troubleshoot ProGuard](#troubleshoot-proguard)

* **Issue**: Missing class `com.google.android.play.core.splitcompat.SplitCompatApplication`.
  **Solution**: Add the following line to your `proguard-rules.pro` file: `-dontwarn com.google.android.play.core.**`.
* **Issue**: Missing class issue due to transitive Flutter dependencies.
  **Solution**: Add the following lines to your `proguard-rules.pro` file:

  ```
  -keep class io.flutter.** { *; }
  -keep class io.flutter.plugins.** { *; }
  -keep class GeneratedPluginRegistrant { *; }
  ```
